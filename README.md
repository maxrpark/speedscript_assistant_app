## Assistant Apps

This project is part of Assitant Apps Projects and use [SpeedScript NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/speedscript)

The idea of Assistant Apps is to create the same app using different languages or frameworks.

I hope, I keep learning new onces in the future so this project expects more and more.
